# PICCAI
PICCAI means Picture (image) classification by using Artificial intelligence with the help of TensorFlow Lite Image Classification model. The task of identifying what an image represents is called image classification. An image classification model is trained to recognize various classes of images. For example, you may train a model to recognize photos representing three different types of animals: rabbits, hamsters, and dogs. TensorFlow Lite provides optimized pre-trained models that you can deploy in your mobile applications.
